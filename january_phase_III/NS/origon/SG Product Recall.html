">Dear ${customer.firstname},<br>
<br>
Greetings from Castlery!<br>
<br>
With a heavy heart, I am here to inform you that we will not be able to fulfill your recent
order with us, as the factory has made a permanent recall of the <strong>[Item Name]</strong>
and have since been discontinued. I understand that this may not be the news you want to
receive but rest assure we are here to help you through.<br />
<br />
Since we are not able to fulfill your order, below are the options we have for you:<br />
<ol>
<li>Full Refund - Upon your confirmation to do a full refund, we will send the request to
the Finance team to process the refund back to the original payment made for this purchase
and the refund will be reflected back into your bank statement between 7 - 14 working days
depending on bank processing time.</li>
<li>Change to other series - If you would like to swap out your purchase for any other
options, we are happy to cover $100 out of the additional cost.</li>
</ol>
I apologise that this has happened and I look forward to your response on which option you are
heading towards so that we can process them accordingly for you.<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience and understanding.
